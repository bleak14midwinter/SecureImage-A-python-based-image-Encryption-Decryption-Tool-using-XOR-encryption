# SecureImage: A Python-Based Image Encryption Decryption Tool

# Developed by Kanishk Kumar 

**SecureImage** is a Python-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images using a simple XOR encryption algorithm. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for easy interaction.

## Features

- **Image Encryption**: Encrypt images using a randomly generated key.
- **Image Decryption**: Decrypt images using the provided key.
- **Save and Load Images**: Save and load both encrypted and decrypted images.
- **Key Management**: Save and load encryption keys.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use interface for performing encryption and decryption operations.

Steps to package your application:

1.Install PyInstaller:

   pip install pyinstaller

2.Package your script: Navigate to the directory where your script is located and run the following command:

   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole your_script.py
   
--onefile: Bundles everything into a single executable file.
--noconsole: (optional) Suppresses the terminal window when running the GUI application.
Locate the Executable: After the command runs, youâ€™ll find the executable in the dist directory.

3. Add Application Icons:
To make your application look professional, you can add an icon:

Convert your icon image to .ico format if it isn't already.
Use the --icon option with PyInstaller:

   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=your_icon.ico your_script.py


<h1>Example Workflow</h1><br>
Choose: Select an image file.<br>
Encrypt: Encrypt the selected image.<br>
Download Encrypted Image: Save the encrypted image to your system.<br>
Upload Encrypted Image and Key: Upload the encrypted image and the key you saved earlier.<br>
Decrypt: Decrypt the uploaded image.<br>
Download Decrypted Image: Save the decrypted image to your system.<br>
