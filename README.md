# SecureImage: A Python-Based Image Encryption Decryption Tool

# Developed by Kanishk Kumar 

**SecureImage** is a Python-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images using a simple XOR encryption algorithm. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for easy interaction.

## Features

- **Image Encryption**: Encrypt images using a randomly generated key.
- **Image Decryption**: Decrypt images using the provided key.
- **Save and Load Images**: Save and load both encrypted and decrypted images.
- **Key Management**: Save and load encryption keys.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use interface for performing encryption and decryption operations.
